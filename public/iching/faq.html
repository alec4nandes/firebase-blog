                <p>
                    Taoism is a philosophy that’s profound yet subtle, confusing
                    yet simple. Rather than seeing contradictions, Taoists
                    recognize the unity in all opposing forces that make up our
                    everyday lives. They call this force the Tao.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Tao, to explain it crudely, is a transcendent and
                    fundamental force above even the perfect balance of

                <p>
                    A well known symbol of Taoism is the combination of yin and
                    yang (☯). The light, expansive energy of yang and heaven
                    dances around the dark, grounded energy of yin and earth,
                    with each side containing some of the other.

                <p>
                    Yin and yang also have different representations: as a
                    broken line (⚋) and as a solid line (⚊) respectively. There
                    are eight combinations of of these two symbols when grouped
                    in threes (2^3=8). These line combinations are called
                    trigrams and represent the elements of the ancient Taoists:

                <p>
                    There are 64 distinct pairs of these 8 trigrams (8x8=64).
                    These six-lined symbols are called
                    <strong>hexagrams</strong> and their meanings are broken
                    down line-by-line in the ancient Chinese text titled the
                    I-Ching.

                <p>
                    The I-Ching is an ancient text from China that is highly
                    regarded among esoteric Taoists. It contains line-by-line
                    divinatory explanations of

                    paired into 64 hexagrams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Millenia ago, oracles interpreted these hexagrams in the
                    patterns of scattered reeds. Later on a simpler method of
                    divination became popular - one using 3 coins.

                <p>
                    Flipping three coins to read the I-Ching is much more
                    straightforward than the ancient way of discerning a
                    <span class="anchor-jump" onclick="anchorJump('trigrams')">

                    in a pile of sticks. The method is as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Flip three coins and add them up: 1 for heads and 0 for
                        tails. This should produce a number from 0-3 each time.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Do this six times, writing the totals in a column from
                        bottom to top (the first line is on the bottom of the
                        hexagram).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Draw these lines next to their totals: (Line codes)

                        * a changing line turns into its opposite to form a new
                        hexagram.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Now take any changing lines in this hexagram and draw
                        their opposites next to them to form a new hexagram. If
                        there are no changing lines, that's okay. If there are,
                        also include the unchanging lines in this new hexagram.

                    <li>
                        The number of changing lines in a reading determines
