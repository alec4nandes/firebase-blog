                <p>
                    Taoism is a philosophy that’s profound yet subtle, confusing
                    yet simple. Rather than seeing contradictions, Taoists
                    recognize the unity in all opposing forces that make up our
                    everyday lives. They call this force the Tao.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Tao, to explain it crudely, is a transcendent and
                    fundamental force above even the perfect balance of

                <p>
                    A well known symbol of Taoism is the combination of yin and
                    yang. The light, expansive energy of yang and heaven dances
                    around the dark, grounded energy of yin and earth, with each
                    side containing some of the other.

                <p>
                    Yin and yang also have different representations: as a
                    broken line (⚋) and as a solid line (⚊) respectively. There
                    are 8 combinations of of these symbols when grouped in
                    threes. These line combinations are called trigrams and
                    represent the elements of the ancient Taoists:

                <p>
                    There are 64 distinct pairs of these 8 trigrams (8x8). These
                    six-lined symbols are called hexagrams and their meanings
                    are broken down line-by-line in the ancient Chinese text
                    titled the I-Ching.

                    The I-Ching is an ancient text from China that is highly
                    regarded among esoteric Taoists. It contains line-by-line
                    divinatory explanations of

                    grouped into 64 hexagrams.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Millenia ago, oracles interpreted these hexagrams in the
                    patterns of scattered reeds. Later on a simpler method of
                    divination became popular - one using 3 coins.
