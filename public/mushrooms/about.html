                        Moving from the dry, canyon-cut mesas of Southern
                        California to the foggy forests of the Bay Area
                        introduced me to the wet world of mycology. Seeing a
                        mushroom pop up overnight on my suburban childhood lawn
                        was rare, but now every stroll through Golden Gate Park
                        offered views of diverse fungi. I soon began checking
                        out books from the local library and scouring online
                        forums in an effort to learn more about mushrooms. There
                        was so much to discover and I couldn't get enough.

                        Going back to school for a masters degree in mycology
                        wasn't a practical option for me, so I created this site
                        instead. It contains medical information, a
                        cross-reference resource of scientific names, and even a
                        geographical discovery API. If you're as fascinated by
                        fungi as I am, I know you will enjoy exploring this
                        site.
